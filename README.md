## Motivation
In this project, we will analyze demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, comparing it against demographics information for the general population. We'll use unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation, identifying the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company. Then, we'll apply what we've learned on a third dataset with demographics information for targets of a marketing campaign for the company, and use a model to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers for the company. The data that we will use has been provided by Udacity's partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.

## Libraries
Python 3.7.3

The libraries we will be using will be:
